- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematical Psychology, Neuroscience, Scientific & Mathematical Thinking and of course a good Speciality Tea.
- 🌱 I’m currently reading through the New Handbook of Mathematical Psychology, and working towards the one-arm handstand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any real mathematical psychology, neursocience of mental representation or any other projects related to nervous systems of living animals.
