- 👋 Hi, I’m @josefmana, aspiring mathematical psychologist, physical culturist and self-proclaimed tea connoisseur.
- 👀 I’m interested in Causal Inference, Bayesian Multilevel Modelling and of course a good Speciality Tea.
- 🌱 I’m currently building statistical models for First Faculty of Medicine at Charles University to help understand neuropsychological traits of patients with Parkinson's disease, and refining my straddle press handstand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects investigating causal inference (in observational and experimental studies) and Bayesian workflow.
- 📫 Reach me on josef.mana@protonmail.com via e-mail or ironmana.mark52 via Messenger
