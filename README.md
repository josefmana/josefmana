- 👋 Hi, I am @josefmana, aspiring mathematical psychologist, physical culturist, and self-proclaimed tea connoisseur.
- 👀 I am interested in Cognitive Neuroscience, Causal Inference, Bayesian Multilevel Modelling, and of course a good speciality tea.
- 🌱 I am currently working at the Institute of Psychology within the Czech Academy of Sciences on projects investigating how similarity judgements are created in the human mind and how human memory for natural scenes works. I am also still refining my straddle press to handstand.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects investigating biologically plausible neural networks to simulate cognitive phenomena we observe in animals, mainly humans.
- 📫 Reach me on josef.mana@protonmail.com or josefmana.jr@gmail.com.
